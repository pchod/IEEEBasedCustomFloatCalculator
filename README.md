# IEEEBasedCustomFloatCalculator

The project converts the denary numbers (either in fractional or decimal point format)
into the one of the IEEE 754 float representation formats and vice versa. IEEE formats to choose:
- binary16;
- binary32;
- binary64;
- custom-length format with arbitrary exponent and mantissa length chosen by the user;

The program will handle normal and subnormal representations along with special cases.

Conversion denary numbers into IEEE 754 representation for arbitrary exponent and mantissa lengths is a common exercise for the computer science students - while
there is a lot of IEEE 754 calculators available on the web it was impossible to find the calculator to reliably check
conversion to custom-length binary strings following IEEE 754 guidelines and rules of calculation.

Moreover this project serves an educational purpose - all of the operations are performed on strings with utilizing no external libraries.
This gave the crucial hand-on experience in working on strings mimicking the bit operations in low-level languages.

The project is being designed mostly as an educational tool for high school and university students. The program will display as well each step performed by the program
along with relevant values (remainders, quotients, information about rounding, loss of precision, etc.)

The UI part will be designed in flask, while the whole backend I wrote in vanilla python.

## Status

ðŸš§ In Progress ðŸš§

The project is still in progress - the planned date of deployment is March 2025. Parts of the logic had underwent
unit tests and work as designed.

## Technical Overview

Backend will be implemented using Flask - early UI using views.

## Testing

Unit tests were prepared and performed on the major parts of the already implemented logic and helped finding bugs
in the implementation.
